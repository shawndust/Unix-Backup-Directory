#The tstamp alias returns the current time as a string of
#digits representing the current time.  The year, day-of-year
#hour, minute, and second at run-time.

#This alias calls the date command with the variables for year,
#day-of-year, hour, minute, second, and outputs them when called.
alias tstamp='(date "+%Y%j%H%M%S")'


#The getname alias prompts the user to provide a filename which is
#read into a variable.

#This is handy because many different aliases may need to get this
#input from the user.  And each time this info is needed, simply
#invoke the getname alias.
alias getname='echo "Please provide a filename: "; read z1810459'


#The vfile alias calls getname, tests the user's input to see if it
#is a regular file and if it is readable.

#First, test if the file is a regular file with -f.  If it's not, then
#print an error to the screen and exit the alias with exit code 1.  If
#it is a regular file, test if it is readable, if not, echo an error
#and exit code 2.
alias vfile='getname; ([ ! -f $z1810459 ] && (echo "Not a regular file") && exit 1) || ( [ ! -r $z1810459 ] && (echo "Cant read") && exit 2) '


#The backup alias calls vfile for a valid file name, copies that name
#into a backup folder, and if another file has the same name, it asks
#permission before overwriting.  It even works if a path is provided
#before the file name.

#Call vfile, remove any pathname from the beginning of that received
#file.  Copy that string into a variable.  Then copy the value of that
#variable into the backup directory.
alias backup='vfile; filename1=`echo $z1810459|sed "s#^.*/##"`; cp -i $filename1 $HOME/Backup'


#The Backup alias backs up a user-selected file into the Backup
#directory and appends the timestamp onto the end of the filename.

#Call vfile to get a valid file. Strip out any path name before the
#file name, copy that into a variable, then copy a file named the
#value of the variable into the Backup directory with the timestamp
#appended at the end.
alias Backup='vfile; filename=`echo $z1810459|sed "s#^.*/##"`; cp -i $filename "$HOME/Backup/$filename.`tstamp`"'


#The finder alias searches for a file based on the user's request.
#First, it asks for the file directory, then the file name.

#First, prompt the user to input the search directory. Read this
#input into a variable. Then, prompt the user for the file name
#to be found, and read that into a variable. Then, use the find
#command to determine whether the requested folder contains the
#requested file.
alias finder='echo "Which directory would you like to search?"; read search_dir 2>/dev/null; echo "Which file would you like to find"; read search_file; find $search_dir $search_file 2>/dev/null'
